# My C Kitchen
### myC_Kitchen
This is a repository containing all my C and C++ code from my course. Each individual lab is organized as a separate branch each labeled per lab. The README in each branch is labeled with the instruction for the lab.

## Lab 1 | ASCII ART
Using C and basic printf() commands we were tasked with creating a small art piece. [Lab 1 PDF](/Lab1ASCIIartCSE130.pdf).

### Takeaways
- This quickly showed me the importance of remembering line spacing. Unlike more complex languages, C requires you to define the new line unlike Java which differentiates them with different print() and println() methods.
- I created a small boat and the object used a lot of "|" and "/" and "\" symbols which required understanding pseudo characters in order to produce them correctly.
