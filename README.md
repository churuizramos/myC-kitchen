# My C Kitchen
### myC_Kitchen
This is a repository containing all my C and C++ code from my course. Each individual lab is organized as a separate branch each labeled per lab. The README in each branch is labeled with the instruction for the lab.

## Lab 1 | ASCII ART
Using C and basic printf() commands we were tasked with creating a small art piece. [Lab 1 PDF](/Lab1ASCIIartCSE130.pdf).

## Lab 2 | Currency Conversion Table
Using C and more advanced printf() commands with the introduction of tab spaces for organization we need to create a currency conversion table that displays the equivalent value of a user-inputted currency in other currencies. [Lab 2 PDF](/Lab2CurrencyXrateCSE130.pdf).

### lab2-jrr.c
1. Display the currency conversion table.
2. User selects a starting currency from the available choices.
3. User unputs a currency amount for this selected currency.
4. The currency choice goes into a switch that corresponds with the starting currency.
5. Within the corresponding currency, the program uses the inputted amount to convert into and save the output variables for each currency.
6. The values are displayed back to the user.
